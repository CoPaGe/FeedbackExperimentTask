# FeedbackExperimentTask

(1)You need to unzip the '500Programs.rar' which contains both buggy/reference programs and tests.

(2)You need to reset the variable 'problemPath' in 'Experiment.java'. For example, in our code, we set 'problemPath = "D:\\xxxxxx\\263A";' if we want to repair the bugs in task 263 A.

(3)Run the main function of 'Experiment.java'.

(4)After the APR terminates, you could read the newly generated log file and observe whether each  buggy program is repaired. The valid patch(if there is one) is the last generated program (candidate patch) which exists  in 'newfile' document .
